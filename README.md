# Bernkastel
ZSH theme based on [ys](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/ys.zsh-theme).

An example image. A user `james` in a directory `~/test` with a default kubectl context named `my-k8s-cluster`, where the current directory is in a git repository on branch `main` and has changes, and the last command returned at 11:47:32 local machine time. Terminal is iTerm2 in light mode on macOS.
